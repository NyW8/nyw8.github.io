Family Widget is a homescreen widget that I created and installed on many of my family member's Android phones. 

I live in a different country than most of my family, and since I am only able to visit them every so often, I decided I wanted a way to keep them a little closer to me. I created an Android widget that is displayed on the homescreen and is able to rotate through images that I have uploaded to an online storage folder. I added this widget to my family member's phones and am now able to upload photos and my family can immediately display that image on their homescreens. It makes us all feel a little closer together.
