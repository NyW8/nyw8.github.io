As part of an entrepreneurship course, we researched, gathered feedback, and created an app called **Showcase** to help actors and others in the film industry connect and advance their careers.

Showcase's final demo:

As part of this course, we created a business model canvas centered around the app, and interviewed professionals who would use our app to connect with others. This led us to create the prototype and focus on the features and aspects that we did. Namely:
 - Creating and supporting connections between actors
 - A highly customizable profile page containing the artist's works, demo reels, appearance, skills, credits, and education
 - Allowing filtering of users by experiences, common connections, and skills

Thank you to my amazing team without whom I would not have been able to complete a project at this scale: [Jackson][jackson] and [Daniela][daniela].

Below are some photos of our app (Showcase). The first is the main feed, second is the networking map view showing a user's connections, and the mini-display of a user that pops up from it. Last is the profile page for a user showing their headshots, data, and credits.
