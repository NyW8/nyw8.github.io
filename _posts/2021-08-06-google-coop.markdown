My internship with Google was the last of my three co-ops. It was both one of the most interesting and complex co-ops that I have worked in.

In the summer between high school and university, I had the privilege to take part in CSSI (Computer Science Summer Institute), a Google-led summer program where accepted students could learn about computer science. This experience was centered around gaining experience with coding in teams and using Google's web services.

In my summer internship, it was very different. Not only did it not focus on external services that Google provided, but it was also a very dissimilar job position than anything I had worked on before. I had not heard of site reliability and had never worked in ops or devops, and so my first task was to learn about what engineers on the SRE team did daily. The [SRE book][sre-book] really helped me with this. 

At the midpoint of my co-op, I was asked to do a takeover for the UTSC co-op instagram account. This takeover was very fun for me to do and I was able to share my experiences and tips with other co-op students, which I enjoyed. This is the takeover:

I learned a lot from this co-op, including what it felt like to work at an internationally known company and how the SRE job works. Although I would have liked to be in person to meet my team and enjoy the experiences there, I found my summer to be a fascinating experience, packed with more than I could have imagined.

Most of the things I did while at Google were confidential, including many of the technologies I used. Thus, the list below of languages/frameworks used is fairly incomplete.

A huge thank you to my team and especially my host and co-host (you know who you are), as well as to my mentor who helped me throughout my internship. It was a great experience.

The Google site is of course [here][google-site], and for a brief history of search, see the video below:
