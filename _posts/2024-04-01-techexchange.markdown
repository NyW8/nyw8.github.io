Each year, Google hosts an annual virtual program titled [TechExchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange) that focuses on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HSBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Selected students spend a semester being taught by volunteer Google instructors and project coaches.

During this program, I mentored a set of four students through a Software Development Studio course. We had weekly meetings, where my role was to:
- Bridge industry expertise
- Provide regular feedback and grading throughout assigned coursework
- Unblock and encourage final project goals
- Create coding demos
- Be available for office hours support
- Lead topic-based lessons
