GlobeNotes is a travel information website designed to be the SparkNotes of travel.

This project was created during Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) program, as part of a final project. 
Our team of four wanted to create an easy-to-use website that allowed someone to quickly find information about where they were traveling. 

We had a week to create it, and decided we had just enough time to make it mobile-optimized (so try it on your phone!).
However, it currently only supports a limited number of countries. We would like to expand our website to include all of them eventually.

Languages/Frameworks used:
{% highlight linenos %}
Python
JavaScript
Google Cloud Platform
HTML
CSS
amCharts #For map on main page
Fixer Api #For currency conversion
{% endhighlight %}

Thank you to my team: Aishani Sil, Akshara Anand, Lance Cook
