During my CSCC01 - Introduction to Software Engineering, the class was split into teams of 5 and given a couple projects to choose to develop. 

Our team, Team 404 Software Ninjas, chose to work on a rewards app that **allows restaurant owners to create an achievement based system for their customers to earn rewards**. It could also have applications elsewhere (e.g. teachers could use a rewards based system for finishing homework or good behaviour, etc and earn things like pencils/erasers/etc).

Languages/Frameworks used:

Vue.js
JavaScript
Quasar

Jest

HUGE shout out to my team for making this such an enjoyable project: [Jackson][jackson], [Alice][alice], [Wilson][wilson], and [Mahdiya][mahdiya].

Below are some photos of our app. The first is the customer's homepage, showing a list of restaurants and the customer's progressed achievements. The second is an example of a restaurant owner's profile page.
