This was my first co-op during university. Here are some of my thoughts on both the position and the company.

I really enjoyed the feel of working at Kobo, everyone I met there was very friendly and tried to help me with everything I had issues with. Another thing I enjoyed was that close to everyone there was a book lover. It was a nice feeling to be surrounded by others who also loved books, which seems to be rare now.

I started as a quality assurance co-op and gradually moved towards doing full-stack development as I got more comfortable with Kobo's system. 

The primary project I worked on was a payment processor switch which included recreating one of the pages from an older side of Kobo's website. The UI that I got to work on was really interesting too. Since it had to work on both EPDs (eReaders), as well as mobile and web devices, there was a lot more to take into consideration.

Thank you to my team (in no order): Joseph, Judy, Sean, Gustav, Yesha, Cheng. All of you made every day interesting and tackled new challenges/problems without complaint.
