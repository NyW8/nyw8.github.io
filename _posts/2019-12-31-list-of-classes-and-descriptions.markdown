# Computer Science classes:

### CSCA08: Introduction to Computer Science I
[Link to course][csca08] 

A basic introduction to computer science using Python and including learning about control structures, data types, and complexity.

### CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II
[Link to course][csca48]

A deeper dive into computer science fundamentals using C programming to illustrate data structures, efficiency, recursion, testing, abstract data types, and starts the conversation on OOP and encapsulation.

### CSCB36: Introduction to the Theory of Computation
[Link to course][cscb36]

Introduces the theories behind computer science, including mathematical logic, mathematical induction, proofs of correctness for algorithms, automata, and more.

### CSCB09: Software Tools and System Programming
[Link to course][cscb09]

Opens the door to Unix/Linux command line and scripting languages using C and bash. Wrote programs to illustrate pipes and filters, basic network programming, and system processes and calls.

### CSC207: Software Design
[Link to course][csc207]

Software design concepts using Java, including unit testing, refactoring, design patterns, regexs, etc. Also has a large group project using Android Studio to create a mobile games app.

### CSCB58: Computer Organization
[Link to course][cscb58]

Design and operation of computers. This includes boolean logic, memory structure, CPU, assembly languages, and instruction execution. Has regular labs and a group project to create a hardware based game.

### CSCB63: Design and Analysis of Data Structures
[Link to course][cscb63]

Looks at the design and implemenation of various efficient data structures and abstract types. Dives into amortized complexity, hashing, red-black trees, disjoint sets, and dynamic tables.

### CSCC24: Principles of Programming Languages
[Link to course][cscc24]

Studies functional programming (e.g. Haskell) to demonstrate definition and analysis in various languages.

### CSCD84: Artificial Intelligence
[Link to course][cscd84]

Theories and algorithms of artificial intelligence through assignments in game playing, decision making with uncertainty, and image recognition. Considers Markov decision processes, neural nets, heuristics, and reinforcement learning.

# Math classes:

### CSCA67: Discrete Mathematics
[Link to course][csca67]

Focuses on combinatorics, conditional probability, graph theory, and problem-solving skills. Also has a large focus on proof techniques and format.

### MATA31: Calculus I
[Link to course][mata31]

Introduces calculus theories and functions, including differentiability, derivatives, optimization, antiderivatives, continuity, and the applications of each.

### MATA37: Calculus II
[Link to course][mata37]

Follows MATA31 above, diving deeper into integral calculus, Riemann sums, Fundamental Theorm of Calulus, integration techniques, and convergence/divergence of a sequence and series. 

### MATA22: Linear Algebra I
[Link to course][mata22]

A conceptual approach to mathematical proofs, and includes matrix algebra, Euclidean n-spaces, linear systems, eigenvalues and vectors, and various theorems.

### MATB24: Linear Algebra II
[Link to course][matb24]

More in-depth from the previous course, introducing inner product spaces, change of basis, and Hermitian matrices. Also includes the least-squares method and an introduction to coding theory.

### MATB41: Techniques of Calculus of Several Variables I
[Link to course][matb41]

A look at partial derivatives in 3D and higher dimensions. Talks about Lagrange multiplies, spherical and cylindrical coordinates, and how the chain rule works.

### STAA57: Introduction to Data Science
[Link to course][staa57]

An introduction to data science using R. This course introduces visualization, sampling, probability, and computational approaches to using real data.

### STAB52: An Introduction to Probability
[Link to course][stab52]

Mathematical models of probability and distribution. Adds a stats background to the computer science and math by talking about the Central Limit Theorem, Weak and Strong Law of Large Numbers, random variables, etc.

# Other classes:

### PHLA10: Reason and Truth
[Link to course][phla10]

Focuses on issues of rationality and how we know about the world around us. Includes conversations about the existance of a God, the knowability of reality, and studies texts through the history of philosophy.

### EESA06: Introduction to Planet Earth
[Link to course][eesa06]

Explores the composition, structure, and origin of the Earth and its history from the last 4.5 billion years. Explains the current challenges (like global warming) that the world is facing and how human societies are impacting us now.

### LGGA60: Introductory Standard Chinese I
[Link to course][lgga60]

An introduction to learning Mandarin, using speech, listening, and reading and writing characters. Starts the path to being able to speak and translate Mandarin.

### LGGA61: Introductory Standard Chinese II
[Link to course][lgga61]

A further introduction to Mandarin, including speech, listening, reading, and writing characters. Builds on the previous introductory course, LGGA60.
