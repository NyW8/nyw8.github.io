Tech Talk is a program I created in collaboration with my local library to help seniors learn how to use technology.

I first realized the need to have a program like this when I began teachning my grandparents how to use their own smartphones and tablets.
I wondered how those without tech-savvy people around them were able to manage technology and decided to do something about it.

With the help of the library, together we launched Tech Talk. 
It focused on pairing seniors and teens to answer the seniors' questions about basic technology problems such as 
sending photos over email, or learning to use the browser on their tablet.

By the end of six months, we had been able to help over 100 local seniors with their tech issues.

As part of recognition of this program, I was invited to take part in the 2018 Youth Library Expo, where I was part of a panel answering questions about getting youth more engaged with their communities and having positive impacts.
In addition, I was awarded the Owen Sound Youth Volunteer of the Year 2018 award for the impact this program had on our community.

I am honoured to have been able to make a difference to those who attended the sessions and hope to make a positive difference in the world and show what is possible to achieve.
